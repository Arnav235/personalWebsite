                            Hello! I am Arnav Paruthi
                        </h4>

                                I believe there are three pillars of a great life: Relationships, Work, and Health. Neither is more important than the other, and it's 
                                all worthless if any one of them is absent. I work to maximize all three.
                            </p>
                            <div class="about_dropdown">
                                <button type="button" class="about_dropdown_button">&nbsp&nbsp Relationships</button>

                                    <p>
                                        If I had to make a choice, I'd say this is the most important aspect of a great life. For me, great relationships are about having people 
                                        around you that you care about, trust, and are comfortable with and open around. Relationships like that are quite precious, they take years 
                                        to build. But that's typical of things that are truly worthwhile.
                                    </p>
                                </div>
                            </div>
                            <div class="about_dropdown">
                                <button type="button" class="about_dropdown_button">&nbsp&nbsp Work</button>
                                <div class="about_collapsable_text">
                                    <p>
                                        Work's greatly prioritized in western societies. And I think it is important, but for different reasons. Money is necessary to live, 
                                        but it doesn't entirely explain why we work. I think people would still work if they had plenty of money, most billionaires at least do. 
                                        In my mind work provides a sense of purpose. My purpose is to push civilization forward. <br><br>
                                        Technology is the best tool I've found to do that. It can't solve all problems, but quite a few of them it can. That's why I've learnt 
                                        so much about it. Technology's also just really cool! Playing with tech and creating things doesn't really feel like "work" to me.
                                    </p>
                                </div>
                            </div>

                                        This part breaks down further into diet, exercise and sleep. Eating well, exercising regularly and sleeping when you're tired is 
                                        about all it takes. Simple in principle, difficult in practice. Mental health is also essential, but for me, I've found it's 
                                        mostly taken care of by having great relationships.

                                    I’ve always been interested in technology. As a child, my interests jumped between iPhones, drones, graphene, and Tesla. At age 14, 
                                    I started learning to code. I’d tried it before and was discouraged by its difficulty, but after doing a course on Codecademy everything 
                                    started to make sense.<br><br>
                                    While watching coding videos, I came across this new concept called AI. Recognizing faces was cool, but I was blown away by the fact that 
                                    these algorithms could beat world-class human players at Atari games and Go (an ancient Chinese board game, considered the hardest classical game). 
                                    I started building my own AI projects and learning about the field. My projects landed me a summer internship at fleetops.ai on the engineering team. <br><br>

                                    Late 2019, after completing an AI project, I thought about what I wanted to do next. While considering my options, I realized that 
                                    everything I’d done so far wasn’t real. Nobody was actually using it, it wasn’t impacting people, and what’s the point of building 
                                    something that doesn’t have a purpose.  <br><br>

                                    So I started researching potential problems I could help solve through technology. Spring of 2020 I did a consulting project with Kidogo, 
                                    a company that runs early childhood development centres in Nairobi’s slums. We aimed to develop a strategy to decrease the ratio of 
                                    children to caretakers without compromising profitability. Through that project, I learnt about the enormous amount of food that’s wasted. 
                                    I then started looking at ways to reduce food loss in the developing world. Specifically, we were figuring out how to distribute hermetic 
                                    bags in rural China. <br><br>

                                    COVID-19 hit, the world shut down, and everyone's focus shifted to the virus. Our project came to a halt as it became difficult to move 
                                    forward. My focus for the next year shifted to doing well at school and university applications. Spring of 2021, I decided on attending 
                                    the University of Toronto's Engineering Science program, one of the world's best engineering programs. <br><br>

                                    As high school came to a close and university applications concluded, I started looking for summer positions and landed a role at Zerodown. 
                                    It was awesome to work in that sort of high standards, fast-paced environment. I built products that used computer vision to automatically 
                                    collect data about a home and neighbourhood, simplifying the home search process.<br><br>

                                    First-year university went well. Engineering Science is a tough program with a lot of work, but I met a lot of really smart, driven people 
                                    and got a great technical foundation. I also somehow got absurdly high grades. Summer 2022 I worked at Munich Re (World's largest 
                                    re-insurance company) on the integrated analytics team, building products that better estimate risk and simplify the insurance 
                                    process, allowing more people to get insured.<br><br>

                                    I loved my time at Munich RE, and decided to take a return offer with them in NYC summer 2023. That was an absolute blast! It was 
                                    awesome to work with Munich RE for another term, and being in NYC was a lot of fun – there’s so much energy, ambition and talent there, it 
                                    raised my bar of what’s possible.<br><br>

                                    Now I’m in third year EngSci, specializing in Machine Intelligence. Excited for what the future holds!

                                aUToronto is UofT's self driving car team. We participate in the SAE Autodrive competition and placed first place overall 
                                for the first five years, and second place in the 6th year.<br>
                                I joined aUToronto in my second year of university, and I'm now proud to be leading the object tracking team! We take in 
                                object detections from the 3D OD, 2D OD and Radar teams, and employ the Hungarian algorithm, Kalman filters and a HMM to 
                                update our object position, velocity and class estimates. Leading a team has been a really great learning experience. 
                                I'd never before taken on any sort of “management” role, and although I still can't quite say I'm an expert, I think I 
                                can now competently lead a team. It's also very fulfilling to help team members develop new skills and explore their 
                                interests. I'm glad I can give back to the community in this way 😊.

                                    After a great summer with Munich RE in the Toronto office, I received a return offer in NYC. I 
                                    really enjoyed my time with the team so I decided to take it!<br>
                                    NYC was an absolute blast. There’s a certain energy, ambition and drive there that’s present in perhaps only 
                                    a few places around the world. This summer raised my bar of what’s possible. The city’s also incredibly diverse 
                                    in every way. I met people from all walks of life. It truly expanded my world view.

                                Munich RE is the world's largest re-insurance company. They essentially sell insurance to insurance companies (I know, mind blown right 🤯). 
                                I worked on the Integrated Analytics (IA) team in the Toronto office as a data engineer, building products to better determine 
                                risk. Overall it was a great experience. IA feels like a startup within a big company. I learned so much about how to architect 
                                and deploy applications for massive scale. It was also interesting to work on a large team and align various stakeholders. I 
                                had many more meetings than I did at startups 😅. Munich RE also had a bunch of fun events! Like an escape room in Casa Loma, 
                                a Blue Jay's game, and a team trip to Six Flags. I also went to NYC for a week to meet the team there and do our final presentation! 
                                That's me at The Edge in Hudson Yards 😄.

                                    I've decided to attend UofT's Engineering Science program! EngSci is a unique interdisciplinary program that 
                                    fosters the integration of various scientific disciplines to address engineering and societal challenges. Courses 
                                    cover a wide range of topics although there's a strong focus on math and physics. I'm fairly set on pursuing a career 
                                    in tech, but I think that EngSci's breadth of knowledge will be useful in creating connections across disciplines, which 
                                    often lead to great innovation. I also really like EngSci's diverse student population. It seems like 
                                    everyone in CS just wants to work in Big Tech, but EngSci's have very different ambitions. I've met incoming EngScis 
                                    who want to build rockets, work in biotech and pursue fundamental scientific research. It's been awesome talking to 
                                    people in a world very different from tech.

                                    Over the last 3 months, I worked with a group of friends to try and reduce this wastage, specifically in China: the 
                                    world's largest food producer. We did mountains of research and spoke to experts. However, making a difference halfway 
                                    around the globe while not speaking Mandarin proved difficult. We decided to stop working on the project, but I 
                                    learnt so much and it was super fun working with the team.

                                    (ECD) centers in Nairobi's slums. During a child's early years, quality care is critical in laying the foundation 
                                    of their social, cognitive, and emotional development. We worked to reduce the ratio of children to staff

                                <p class="blog-description"> Fleetops is a startup building a platform to match shippers with truck drivers using AI. 
                                    This means drivers find loads more quickly and have a larger percentage of their truck full, while shippers 
                                    get a better price. I built data pipelines using apache beam, and a recommendation system suggesting truckloads to drivers.
                                    This was an awesome experience and I learnt so much!
